 
## Intro
- This is a super simple boilerplate example showing an RSS reader (using feednami library capabilities)

- this looks a good starting point for using react + redux + redux-router


## Features

- latest `react`, `redux`, `react-router`
- `devtools` + `HMR` for development
- `react`
  - higher-order components
  - higher-order functions
- `redux`
  - bootstrap initial state
  - middleware composition
  - easy-to-configure reducers
  - async actions
- `react-router`
  - nested routes
  - keep routes into state for easy time travel
- CSSnext bundles
  - injected into HTML by webpack for development (allows `HMR`)
  - bundled as a separate file for production

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
